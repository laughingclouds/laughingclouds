### Hi there

I'm Hemant "laughingclouds" Bhandari (he/him), and this is my GitHub profile. Like myself, it is a constant work in progress.

Please feel free to check out my projects.

I'm open to any ideas or suggestions.

Like many things in life, GitHub gists can also be obscured for many. I don't put much in here, but you could still [have a look ðŸ™‚](https://gist.github.com/laughingclouds).

I am taking my time learning about jekyll and github pages. And you can see what this repository looks like using it, from [here](https://laughingclouds.github.io/laughingclouds/).

My best work is pinned below, have a look!
