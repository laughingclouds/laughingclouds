# $\downarrow$

**Hi there**

I'm Hemant _"laughingclouds"_ Bhandari (he/him), and this is my GitHub profile. <br> Like myself, it is a constant work in progress.

I've loved programming and computer science since I was in school. These were the only things I could say I was good at - other than Mathematics - and I stuck with them for my college degree (BE CSE).

I started using linux at school and migrated from Ubuntu, to Pop!_OS, Debian, to finally daily driving [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) (btw). <br> I wish to contribute to it (and many more foss projects) someday.

## Current

_Right now_, I'm working on three main projects (you can also find them pinned below)

- [Montagne - Markdown editor in Rust, using Iced gui framework](https://github.com/laughingclouds/Montagne)
- [Kumo - Simple PDF reader in C++, using poppler and dear imgui](https://github.com/laughingclouds/Kumo)
- [tgos(The Generic Operating System) - A Linux From Scratch project](https://github.com/laughingclouds/Kumo)

## Languages

Here are some languages I'm great at, and some that I'm learning. All in all, these are languages I had a great time working with:

- Python
- C++
- C
- JavaScript
- Golang
- Rust

> Loosely ordered by which ones I learned first.

## Tools/Frameworks

Some tools/frameworks I've dabbled with till now:

- django, flask
- [drogon](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon) (c++), [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [poppler](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler), [gem5](https://www.gem5.org/) (simulator)
- reactjs, nextjs
- [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) (rust)
- spring boot

> Loosely ordered by which ones I'm most comfortable with.
